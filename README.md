# DocSearch configurations

## DEPRECATED

This repository is not maintained anymore in favor of [our new infrastructure](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/migrating-from-legacy).

All of the configs can now be edited directly from [our web interface](https://crawler.algolia.com/) which also offer you a way to start new crawls.

If you have not joined your new application yet, please check your emails! :D

## Summary

If you're looking for a way to add DocSearch to your site, the easiest solution
is to [apply to DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/apply). If you want to have a look at configurations to [run your own scraper](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/legacy/run-your-own/) you're at the right place.

## Options

Please check the [dedicated documentation](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/legacy/config-file) to have the list of all available
options along with examples.
